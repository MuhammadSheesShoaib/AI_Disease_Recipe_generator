While the eggplant bakes, mix crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper in a separate large baking dish.\n\n7.

Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of the eggplants. *Tip: You may set aside some marinara sauce to drizzle on the final dish for presentation*\n\n8.

I'm really sorry to hear about your diagnosis, but I'm glad you're taking steps to care for yourself. In general, a heart-healthy diet should include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats. Here's a simple and delicious recipe for Grilled Salmon with Quinoa-Vegetable Medley.\n\n**Grilled Salmon with Quinoa-Vegetable Medley**\n\nIngredients:\n#### For the Salmon:\n- 2 salmon fillets (4-6 oz each)\n- 1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce\n- 1 tbsp honey\n- 1 tbsp olive oil\n- Freshly ground black pepper\n\n#### For the Quinoa-Vegetable Medley:\n- 1 cup uncooked quinoa\n- 2 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth\n- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\n- 1 medium red bell pepper, chopped\n- 1 medium yellow bell pepper, chopped\n- 1 medium onion, chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 cup chopped fresh spinach\n- 2 medium tomatoes, chopped\n- Freshly ground black pepper\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Prepare the salmon: Preheat broiler over high heat. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, honey, and olive oil. Brush the mixture onto both sides of the salmon fillets. Season with a little pepper. Place the salmon fillets on a broiling pan, skin-side down (if applicable) for broiling or a grill pan for grilling. Broil or grill for 4-6 minutes per side, or until the salmon is opaque and flakes easily with a fork. Tip: If using a broiler, be careful not to let the pan come into contact with the flame.\n\n2. While the salmon cooks, prepare the quinoa-vegetable medley: Rinse the quinoa in a fine mesh strainer and place in a medium saucepan with chicken or vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook covered for 12-15 minutes, until liquid is absorbed.\n3. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chopped red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, onion and garlic, cook until tender, about 5 to 7 minutes.\n4. Add the cooked quinoa, spinach, and tomatoes to the skillet, cook for another 2-3 minutes, until heated through and slightly softened. Season with a little ground pepper to taste.\n\n5. Serve the grilled salmon over the quinoa-vegetable medley and enjoy a delicious, heart-healthy meal!\n\n**Notes:** Adjust the amount of soy sauce and honey in the marinade based on your personal taste preferences. Be mindful of portion sizes by keeping the salmon fillets to 4-6 oz each, and to keep windows for additional vegetables and whole grain options in your meal plan. When cooking with canned broth, look for low-sodium options. As always, feel free to discuss with your healthcare provider to ensure a diet suitable for your unique conditions.\n\nHope this recipe is helpful and enjoyable!

Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or until the water has been absorbed.\n\n2. While the quinoa is cooking, heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
